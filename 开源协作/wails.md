## 介绍

Hi 👋 !

我是一个 Golang 开发者，我很早就注意到了wails，并进行了早期的测试，它运行起来的结果让我欣喜若狂。

I'm a Golang developer, and I noticed wails early on and did some early testing, and was ecstatic with the results when it got up and running.

最近我正在使用 wails 打造一款系统工具，我注意到一些特定语言的文档翻译落后于当前版本，我期待能够参与并将文档翻译成我的语言(中文)

Recently I've been working on a system tool using wails, and I've noticed that the translation of some of the language-specific documentation is lagging behind the current version, and I'm looking forward to getting involved and translating the documentation into my language (Chinese)!

祝您度过愉快的一天！

Have a great day!
